                    <p>Espresso with added hot water (100–150 ml). Often served in a cappuccino cup. (The espresso is
                        added into the hot water rather than all the water being flowed through the coffee that would
                        lead to over extraction.)

                    <p>A tall, mild 'milk coffee' (about 150-300 ml). An espresso with steamed milk and only a little
                        milk foam poured over it. Serve in a latte glass or a coffee cup. Flavoured syrup can be added.

            <h3>Coffee Beans</h3>
            <p>True love these days can be found in a lot of creative places—online, at a bar, or the old-fashioned way,
                on a blind date. But to a true coffee lover, the relationship they want and need is found every morning
                (noon and night, sometimes!) at the bottom of their favorite mug. Black, cream, sugar, foam, no foam,
                these preferences could easily divide nations, it seems, because people LOVE their coffee a certain and
                often will not budge on changing it. Growing up in Seattle, where Starbucks is the Mothership, and craft
                coffee shops are found on every corner, I grew up thinking coffee and coffee culture was a normal way of
                life. But for many people, coffee is just what gets you going in the morning. You fill up your trusty
                thermos or travel mug with whatever you’ve got ground up or in a pod and you’re off for the day. So if
                that’s you, and you’d like to experience a deeper affinity and appreciation for one of God’s finest
                beverages, then look no further than these quotes. And if you’re on the hunt for what to buy your
                coffee-crazed friend or family member, look no further than our coffee lover gift guide!</p>
